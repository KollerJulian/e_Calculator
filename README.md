Simple python script using eulers formula for his const e

I lost the original changelog, version 0.10 an 1.00 of the code..

sry my dudes :/


This program calculates the e value using the euler's number formula  in an successive approximation.
Calculated value of e will be written to an automatically generated
external file (e.txt) in the folder where the e_Calculator_(v.X.XX).py file is located.
e.txt will be overwritten if it already exists.
Program will be interrupted if the e_Calculator.py file is stored in an write protected folder.
